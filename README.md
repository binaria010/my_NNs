# my_NNs
Implementation of deep neural network for classification from scratch.

In the file my_nn.py you can find the class my_MPL, a deep neural network with several methods and attributes. 
Optimization methods and testing functions are implemented following Andrew Ng courses from the DeepLEarninig specialization from Coursera.

the file Examples.ipynb contains several examples usign all kinds of techinques to improve the accuracy of the algorithm.

The file test.py contains some functions to test the implementation of backkprop (gradient checking), test cost with regularization term and mini_batch gradient descent.
